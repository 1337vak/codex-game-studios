Read [Codex compatibility](../../COMPATIBILITY.md) before following this workflow.

Codex adaptation: `<plugin-root>` is two directories above this skill. Read `<plugin-root>/skills/game-studio/references/compatibility.md` before applying source procedures. Use the current host's tools and existing user authorization. Source per-file prompts do not reset that authorization. Source shell preprocessing is not executed: resolve needed project configuration explicitly. Shared source scripts and hooks are reference-only until separately reviewed; use the authored game-studio helper for supported asset observations. Preserve domain decision options and report missing evidence as NOT ASSESSED.

Read [the complete workflow](WORKFLOW.md) and only the supporting references relevant to this request.
