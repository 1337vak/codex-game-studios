# Test Setup

This skill scaffolds the automated testing infrastructure for the project.
It detects the configured engine, generates the appropriate test runner
configuration, creates the standard directory layout, and wires up CI/CD
so tests run on every push.

Run this once during the Technical Setup phase, before any implementation
begins. A test framework installed at sprint start costs 30 minutes.
A test framework installed at sprint four costs 3 sprints.

**Output:** `tests/` directory structure + `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
